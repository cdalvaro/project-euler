# Project Euler Challenges

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve
into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Structure

This project is composed by the [`Challenges`](challenges) library, where you can find algorithms for each Project Euler challange inside its corresponding directory. And the [`tests`](tests) directory, which contains the verification of each challenge algorithm.

Tests are built using [_Xcode Unit Tests_](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/UnitTesting.html) for integration with Xcode IDE tests suite.

## Solutions

Solutions are located inside `challenges/cXYZ` directory, where `XYZ` is the callenge number following the [Archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives) section on Project Euler webpage.
