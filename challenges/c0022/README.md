# [Challenge 22 - Names scores](https://projecteuler.net/problem=22)

## Description

Using [names.txt](names.txt), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, `COLIN`, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the _938th_ name in the list. So, `COLIN` would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49,714.

## Exercise

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

## Solution

You can find the algorithm to solve this challenge inside [challenge.cpp](challenge.cpp).
