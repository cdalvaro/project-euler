#  [Challenge 6 - Sum square difference](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

## Description

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

<div align=center>
  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1^{2}%2B2^{2}%2B...%2B10^{2} = 385">
</div>

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

<div align=center>
  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(1%2B2%2B...%2B10)^{2} = 55^{2} = 3025">
</div>

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is `3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640`.

## Exercise

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
